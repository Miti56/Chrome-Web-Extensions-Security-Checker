# Web Extension Source Code Analyzer

## Introduction

The **Web Extension Source Code Analyzer** is a web project that allows you to analyze the source files of a web extension and determine whether it is potentially dangerous or not. This tool is built using HTML, PHP, CSS, and MySQL and is designed to provide insights into the code of web extensions to help users make informed decisions about their safety.

## Features

- **Upload Extension Source Files**: Users can upload the source files of a web extension in the form of a compressed archive (e.g., ZIP file).

- **Code Analysis**: The analyzer parses the uploaded source files to examine the code within the extension.

- **Danger Assessment**: It assesses the code for potential security risks and identifies potentially dangerous code patterns.

- **Database Integration**: The tool utilizes MySQL to store and manage information about previously analyzed extensions and their safety status.

- **User Authentication**: Users may need to create an account and log in to access the analysis service, ensuring privacy and accountability.

- **Reporting**: After analysis, users receive a detailed report indicating whether the extension is safe or potentially dangerous. The report may include information about the detected issues.

## Getting Started

To set up and use the Web Extension Source Code Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the following components installed and configured:
   - A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache or Nginx)
   - MySQL database server
   - PHP extensions required for file uploads

2. **Database Setup**: Create a MySQL database to store analysis data. Import the provided SQL schema to set up the required tables.

3. **Configure Database Connection**: Update the PHP configuration file (`config.php`) with your database credentials.

4. **Web Server Configuration**: Configure your web server to host the project files. Ensure that PHP is correctly configured and enabled.

5. **Upload Source Files**: Users can visit the web application and upload the source files of a web extension in a compressed archive (e.g., ZIP).

6. **Analysis**: The uploaded source code will be analyzed for potential security risks.

7. **Reporting**: Users will receive a report indicating whether the extension is safe or potentially dangerous. This report can be viewed on the web application.

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper security measures to prevent unauthorized access and protect user data.

- Use input validation and sanitization to prevent code injection attacks.

- Regularly update and patch the server, PHP, and other software components to address security vulnerabilities.

- Implement rate limiting and other measures to prevent abuse of the analysis service.
